                        <p>Such as the Percy Jackson and Kane Chronicals series. I like how these are "historically" accurate with what the gods did/do.</p>

                        <p>Taco Bell, McDonalds, Dominos, and Subway are my favorite places to eat from.</p>

                        <p>For some reason, "dead" memes seem to always make me laugh. Robbie Rotten has found De Wei.</p>
